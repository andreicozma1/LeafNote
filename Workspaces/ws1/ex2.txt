Macbeth, Act I, Scene II [The merciless Macdonwald]
William Shakespeare - 1564-1616

A Sergeant, explaining Macbeth's courage in battle against the rebel Macdonwald

The merciless Macdonwald—

Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
The multiplying villanies of nature
Do swarm upon him—from the western isles
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak;
For brave Macbeth—well he deserves that name—
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him...
