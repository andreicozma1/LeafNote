When that I was and a little tiny boy
William Shakespeare - 1564-1616

When that I was and a little tiny boy,
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
A foolish thing was but a toy,
    For the rain it raineth every day.

But when I came to man's estate,
    With hey, ho, . . .
'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate
    For the rain, . . .

But when I came, alas! to wive,
    With hey, ho, . . .
By swaggering could I never thrive,
    For the rain, . . .

But when I came unto my beds,
    With hey, ho, . . .
With toss-pots still had drunken heads,
    For the rain, . . .

A great while ago the world begun,
    With hey, ho, . . .
But that's all one, our play is done.
    And we'll strive to please you every day.
